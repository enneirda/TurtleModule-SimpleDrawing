# My First Turtle Graphics Program

This program uses the turtle module to draw a simple picture. 

Each portion of the picture is represented by a different function which is called at main, after the user enters a number between 1 and 150 to scale the picture.

## Picture scaled at radius 50
![](/scale_50.png)

## Picture scaled at radius 150
![](/scale_150.png)
