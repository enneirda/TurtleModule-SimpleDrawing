# My First Turtle Graphics Programs

## A Beautiful Day
This program uses the turtle module to draw a simple picture. 

Each portion of the picture is represented by a different function which is called at main, after the user enters a number between 1 and 150 to scale the picture.

__Picture scaled at radius 50__
![](/scale_50.png)

__Picture scaled at radius 150__
![](/scale_150.png)

## Many Random Flowers
This draws many random colors using random positions, scales and colors
